Compelled by intense peer pressure to have a personal website. Urgently in need of a sense of secerity when filling up the "website" column in resume template. So here I am, finally ate that frog 🐸 and set it up.

KISS is all I need. 💋

### Seriously now,
![My face](image.png)

I am a year 3 computer engineering student at National University of Singapore. I spent most of my time in robotics, specifically at The Bumblebee. We build autonomous submarines and surface vessels, its pretty cool, you should [check it out](https://bumblebee.sg/).

Mostly, I am still trying to find a place in the world. You know about undergrads, we have a lot of dreams but much less experiences. A little more research & development stuff is what I am looking for at the moment.

By the way, I am in the midst of a 6-month internship with Airbus. If you talk to me about it, you will realise how much I like the [Belugas](https://aircraft.airbus.com/en/aircraft/freighters/belugaxl). They are just amazing!

### Future Plan for this website...
Right now I am commiting minimum effort for this website. It is hosted on github pages.

But I see the potentional of it as a side-project. So yeah, wait for me to slowly upgrade this page graphically.
